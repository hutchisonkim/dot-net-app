# Chess Complete Flow Test Results

This directory contains test results from the `CompleteFlow_StartMoveSaveNewLoad_RestoresPawnPosition` test.

## Test Flow

The test demonstrates the complete chess game lifecycle with save/load verification:

1. **Start** - Create a new chess game with initial board setup
2. **First Move** - Make a move (white pawn from e2 to e4)
3. **Save** - Save the game state (with white pawn at e4)
4. **Second Move** - Make another move (black pawn from e7 to e5)
5. **Load** - Load the saved game state, restoring to step 3 (white pawn at e4, black pawn still at e7)

## Key Verification

The test verifies that **the pawn position is correctly restored** after loading:
- After the first move, the white pawn is at e4
- After saving and making a second move, the black pawn moves to e5
- **After loading**, the board returns to the saved state: white pawn at e4, black pawn back at e7
- This proves the save/load functionality correctly preserves and restores piece positions
