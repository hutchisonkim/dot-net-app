# Chess Complete Flow Test Results

This directory contains test results from the `CompleteFlow_StartMoveSaveNewLoad_RestoresPawnPosition` test.

## Test Flow

The test demonstrates the complete chess game lifecycle:

1. **Start** - Create a new chess game with initial board setup
2. **Move** - Make a move (white pawn from e2 to e4)
3. **Save** - Save the game state
4. **New** - Create a new game (resets board)
5. **Load** - Load the previously saved game
