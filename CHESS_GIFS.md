# Chess CompleteFlow Tests - Visual Proof

This document provides links to the animated GIF visualizations that demonstrate each test flow working correctly.

## How to View the GIFs

The GIF files are located in the repository at:
- `tests/Examples.Tests.UI/test-results/`

You can view them by:
1. Navigating to the test-results directory in GitHub
2. Clicking on each GIF file to see the animation
3. Or downloading them locally

## Test Flow Visualizations

### Test 1: CompleteFlow_StartMoveSaveMoveLoad_RestoresPawnPosition

**Flow**: start → move → save → move → load

**File**: [`chess_complete_flow.gif`](tests/Examples.Tests.UI/test-results/chess_complete_flow.gif)

**What it shows**:
- Step 1: Initial board after starting new game
- Step 2: White pawn moved from e2 to e4
- Step 3: Game state saved
- Step 4: Black pawn moved from e7 to e5
- Step 5: After load, board restored to Step 3 (white at e4, black at e7)

**Key verification**: The load operation successfully discards the move made in Step 4, restoring the exact state that was saved in Step 3.

### Test 2: CompleteFlow_StartMoveSaveNewLoad_ShowsSinglePawnMoved

**Flow**: start → move → save → new → load

**File**: [`chess_flow2_start_move_save_new.gif`](tests/Examples.Tests.UI/test-results/chess_flow2_start_move_save_new.gif)

**What it shows**:
- Step 1: Initial board after starting new game
- Step 2: White pawn moved from e2 to e4
- Step 3: Game state saved
- Step 4: "New Game" clicked - board reset to initial state
- Step 5: After load, board restored to Step 3 (white at e4)

**Key verification**: Even after resetting the board with "New Game", the load operation successfully restores the saved state because the game ID was preserved.

### Test 3: CompleteFlow_StartMoveMoveEatSaveNewLoad_ShowsPawnMovedTwiceAndEaten

**Flow**: start → move → move → eat → save → new → load

**File**: [`chess_flow3_moves_and_capture.gif`](tests/Examples.Tests.UI/test-results/chess_flow3_moves_and_capture.gif)

**What it shows**:
- Step 1: Initial board after starting new game
- Step 2: White pawn moved from e2 to e4
- Step 3: Black pawn moved from e7 to e5
- Step 4: White pawn captures black d7 pawn and moves to d6
- Step 5: Game state saved
- Step 6: "New Game" clicked - board reset to initial state
- Step 7: After load, board restored to Step 5 (complex state with capture)

**Key verification**: The load operation successfully restores a complex game state including:
- Multiple piece movements
- A captured piece (black d7 pawn)
- Correct positions for all moved pieces

## Technical Details

### GIF Specifications
- **Format**: GIF89a
- **Dimensions**: 900 x 750 pixels
- **Frame duration**: 1500ms per frame
- **Size**: 
  - Test 1 & 2: ~104KB each
  - Test 3: ~144KB (more frames)

### Content
Each frame shows:
- Complete chess board (8x8 grid)
- Chess pieces using Unicode symbols (♔♕♖♗♘♙ for white, ♚♛♜♝♞♟ for black)
- Game ID
- Game Type
- Last Updated timestamp
- Step description (e.g., "1. Start", "2. First Move", etc.)

### Generation
The GIFs are automatically generated by the test suite using Python with PIL (Pillow) library:
- Parses HTML screenshots captured during test execution
- Renders each frame with chess board and game state
- Combines frames into animated GIF
- Also creates merged PNG showing all frames side-by-side

## Conclusion

These GIF visualizations provide clear visual proof that all three Chess CompleteFlow tests are working correctly and demonstrating the intended save/load persistence behavior.
